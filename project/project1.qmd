# 1. Dogs Data

![many dogs :0](https://theonlinedogtrainer.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/3d09e7f2-20e0-4ac4-be7f-bf010998f778-1.png)


```{r}
breed <- c('Beagle', 'Bulldog', 'Collie', 'German Shepherd', 'Golden Retriever', 'Greyhound', 'Labrador Retriever', 'Pomeranian', 'Pug', 'Shiba Inu')

avg_life <- c(12L, 9L, 13L, 9L, 11L, 12L, 11L, 14L, 14L, 15L)

energy <- factor(c('high', 'medium', 'medium', 'medium', 'very high', 'high', 'very high', 'medium', 'medium', 'medium'), levels = c('medium', 'high', 'very high'))

trainability <- c(0.6, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 1, NA, 1, 0.6, 0.6, 0.4)

friendly <- c(T, T, T, F, T, T, F, F, T, F)
```

## Subscripting

breed with the longest average life expectancy diameter:
```{r}
breed[which.max(avg_life)]
```

number of unfriendly breeds:

```{r}
sum(friendly == F)
```

median trainability value of those breeds that are friendly:

```{r}
median(trainability[friendly == T][-5])
```

number of breeds that have average life expectancy values smaller than the median average
life expectancy:

```{r}
length(breed[avg_life < median(avg_life)])
```

How many breeds have medium energy level and tend to be very friendly?

```{r}
length(breed[energy == 'medium' & friendly])
```

What breeds have medium energy level and tend to be very friendly?

```{r}
breed[energy == 'medium' & friendly]
```

What is the minimum trainability value for those breeds with an average lifetime of
13 years or more?

```{r}
min(trainability[avg_life >= 13])
```

# 2. Vectorized Functions

Is It Vectorized?

1. length() - no. It returns a singular number corresponding to the length of the vector.

```{r}
vec <- c(1, 2, 2.5, 3)
length(vec)
```

2. * - yes. This multiplies every element in a vector and returns an output for each one.

```{r}
vec * 5
```

3. log() - yes. this takes the log of every element in a vector and returns a list with all of them.

```{r}
log(vec)
```

4. max() - no. this compares all elements of a vector and returns the greatest one. there is only one output.

```{r}
max(vec)
```

5. trunc() - yes. this truncates the decimal values of numerical items in the vector. it then returns the full vector with truncated elements.

```{r}
trunc(vec)
```

# 3 Loan Amortization Payment Formula

Suppose that one of your friends recently graduated from a College in California with
$45,000 in student loan debt, at an interest rate of 5.25%. What would be the monthly
payment if your friend wants to pay-off their student loan in 20 years?


```{r}
payment <- function(p, r, n, k){
    pmt = p * (
       ((r/k) * ((1 + r/k) ** (n*k))) / (((1 + r/k) ** (n*k)) - 1)
    )
    return(pmt)
}

payment(45000, 0.0525, 20, 12)
```

Your friend has various monthly payments to make such as rent, car loan, cell-phone,
internet, streaming services, etc. With so many things to pay for, your friend is thinking
of making monthly payments of $220 to pay for their student loan. How many years would
it take your friend to be student-loan debt free if they plan to make monthly payments of
$220? Hint: use a trial-and-error process for various values of 𝑛 to find the answer.


```{r}
payment(45000, 0.0525, 1:50, 12)
```

43 years.

# 4 Future Value of Ordinary Annuity

Mrs. Savingswood wants to save money for the college education of her 3 year-old daugh-
ter. She plans to deposit $100 at the end of each month, for the next 15 years, into a
mutual fund that gives—on average—a 10% annual rate of return. How much money will
Mrs. Savingswood have at the end of 15 years?


```{r}
annuity <- function(PMT = 100, rate = 0.05, n_yrs = 20, comp_per = 12){ # PMT is the amount contributed every period, rate is the interest rate, n_yrs, is the number of years, and comp_per is the number of compounding periods per year
    if(rate == 0){
        fv = PMT * n_yrs * comp_per #fv is the future value
    } else{
        fv = PMT * (
            ((1 + rate/comp_per) ** (n_yrs*comp_per) - 1) / 
                (rate/comp_per)
        )
    }
    return(fv)
}
```

How much money will she have after 15 years?

```{r}
annuity(rate = 0.1, n_yrs = 15)
```

She will have $41447.03! Thats a lot!
