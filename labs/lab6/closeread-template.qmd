This is a sample closeread document. @cr-iris

The narrative appears on this side bar (left margin).

The image on the right depicts three species of iris flowers and their corresponding Sepal and Petal elements.

:::

We refer to this image element as a __sticky__ element. Why? Because as you scroll down, the image of the iris flowers gets stuck in the same place. 

When you trigger a sticky element, it will be displayed in the main section 
(to the right of this sidebar).


Here's another sticky element. It's a simple scatter plot based on the `iris` data set, which is a built-in data frame in R. @cr-plot1

::: {#cr-plot1}
```{r}
ggplot(data = iris, 
       aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length, color = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Iris flowers",
       x = "Sepal Length", 
       y = "Petal Length")
```

| This narrative section is displayed as a continuous piece of text instead of being broken down into separated paragraphs.
|
| There are 3 species of iris flowers:
|
| - Setosa (red)
| - Versicolor (green)
| - Virginica (blue)


Here's a third sticky element. @cr-table1

::: {#cr-table1}
```{r}
iris |>
  group_by(Species) |> 
  summarize(avg_sepal_length = mean(Sepal.Length),
            sd_sepal_length = sd(Sepal.Length)) |> 
  knitr::kable(format = "html")
```
:::

It's just a table with summary statistics.


And finally a fourth sticky element. @cr-plot2

::: {#cr-plot2}
```{r}
ggplot(data = iris, 
       aes(x = Sepal.Length, fill = Species)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, color = "white") +
  facet_wrap(~ Species) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
:::

A colorful plot using facets to show the distribution of Sepal Length among the three iris species.
